# #Inspiration15
This repository contains the resources for the [Minecraft Pi](http://pi.minecraft.net/)/[Python](https://www.python.org/) programming workshop run at [Barking &amp; Dagenham College](http://www.barkingdagenhamcollege.ac.uk/)'s #Inspiration15 event.

The workshop was run by [David Bower, @rddave](https://twitter.com/rddave).

[Raspberry Pis](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) kits on which to run the sessions were kindly made available by [explore STEM](http://www.explorestem.co.uk/) and were funded by [IET Faraday](http://faraday.theiet.org/).

## House Building Challenge

The workshop pulls together [David Whale](https://twitter.com/whaleygeek)'s Minecraft Pi and Python flash cards in to a series of challenges that lead to an open ended "programme a house in Minecraft Pi/Python" challenge.

The challenges start with simply copying out a simple "Hello World" programme.  There are 10 challenges in all, each building upon the skills learnt in the previous challenge.

The challenges are:

1. **"Hello World"** - display a message in the Minecraft world.  Introduce the Minecraft Pi / Python link.  Are there any occasions in games (in general) when you might want to display messages to the gamer?
2. Programmatically **add single blocks** in to the Minecraft world.
3. Introduce the **"for" loop** construct - extend a single block in to a row.  Why not use copy and paste for a row of blocks?
4. Extend the row of blocks to a 2D wall of blocks - a **double "for" loop**.  What does a double "for" loop / 2D array "look" like?  What would a triple "for" loop / 3D array "look" like?
5. **Simplify your code** - replace the double "for" loop with the Minecraft Pi command *setBlock**s***.
6. Integrate **user input** to create walls of any size, in any material (block type).  Is user input validation required?  Can *any* size wall be built?
7.  Better understand the Minecraft **coordinate geometry** system to make the four connecting outer walls of a house.
8.  Extend use of Minecraft's coordinate geometry to **add doors and windows** to the outer walls.
9.  **Plant a garden** by creating flower blocks behind *Steve* as he walks about the Minecraft world using the *getPos* command.
10. **Open ended code a house challenge!**
